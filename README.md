# FolderColor


FolderColor is a small macOS app I built for myself because my desktop is a mess and I can never find anything. Now I can color my folders and instantly know where everything is.

## Requirements

- macOS 14.6 or later

---

## Features

- Color a folder with predefined colors or a custom hex code.  
- Preview the icon before applying.  
- Reset a folder to remove the color.  
- Simple drag & drop to select a folder.  
- Colors appear directly on your macOS desktop.

## Installation

1. Unzip the file.  
2. (Optional) Drag the app to your **Applications** folder.  
3. Launch the app and start coloring your folders!

## How to Use

1. Drag a folder into the drag & drop area.  
2. Click a color or enter a hex code.  
3. Click **Apply** to change the folder color.  
4. Click **Reset** to restore the default icon.

## Notes

- macOS may ask for permission to open an app downloaded outside the App Store.  
- This is a small personal project, but I hope itâ€™s useful to others too!
